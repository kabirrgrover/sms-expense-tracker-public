## Why Spill?

Let's be real—expense tracking apps are boring. You download them, use them for two weeks, then forget they exist. 

Spill is different. It lives in your text messages. Just tell it what you spent like you're venting to a unhinged friend, and it handles the rest. It's fast, it's natural, and it actually makes tracking money *fun* (yes, really).
